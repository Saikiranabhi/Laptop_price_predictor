## 🚀 Features
- Predicts laptop prices based on brand, type, RAM, weight, screen, CPU, storage, GPU, and OS.
- Interactive web app for easy user input and instant results.
- Trained on a real dataset of 1300+ laptops.
- Multiple regression models evaluated; Random Forest chosen for best performance.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for accurate predictions.

## 📚 Important Notes
- The model predicts prices based on the data it was trained on; results may not generalize to all laptops.
- For best results, deploy using Streamlit Cloud or similar services.
- Large model/data files (`pipe.jb`, `data.jb`) may not be suitable for all deployment environments.
